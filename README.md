## Overview

The Parsec SDK allows your application to make interactive, low-latency peer-to-peer connections. The SDK handles the low level internals of peer-to-peer connectivity, networking, and hardware accelerated video/audio processing. The SDK can be deeply integrated into your application, allowing you to use your own back-end and authentication systems. It is lightweight, consisting of a [single header file](/sdk/parsec.h) and a shared object < 5MB.
